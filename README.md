compile test.cpp using the following flags (ubuntu):
g++ test.cpp -lncurses -lGL -lGLU -lglut

main.cpp won't do anything until stable releases which i think wont be up anytime soon :)

pending:
- complex t-spins
- drop indicator
- fix hold mechanic
- remove deprecated methods
- show next pieces on ui
